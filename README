In Vim, pressing ga on a character reveals its representation in decimal, octal, and hex.  Characterize.vim modernizes this with the following additions:

* Unicode character names: U+00A9 COPYRIGHT SYMBOL
* Vim digraphs (type after <C-K> to insert the character): Co, cO
* Emoji codes: :copyright:
* HTML entities: &copy;
